Algorithm:

1. Store team scores in a list.

2. Sort scores in descending order.

3. Input score to search.

4. Search the score in the list.

   • If found, print rank (position)

   • Else print "Not found!"

output:

Ranking (High to low): [95, 90, 88, 78, 72, 65, 56]

Enter team score to search: 78

Team with score 78 is ranked 4

Scenario 2: User enters a score that is NOT in the list (e.g., 50)

Ranking (High to low): [95, 90, 88, 78, 72, 65, 56]

Enter team score to search: 50

Score not found
